# Hi there! 👋 I'm Revanth Anil Kumar  

🌟 **Welcome to my GitHub!**  
I’m a second year Computer Science student who enjoys building things that actually work.
I spend most of my time coding, making projects, breaking things, fixing them, and learning how real systems are built.
My current focus areas are AI systems, agent based architectures, data analytics, and problem solving.
I'm currently learning AI/ML, Cybersecurity and Quant.

## 🧠 Key Projects

### Talk2Data
An enterprise inspired RAG based internal knowledge assistant
Built using embeddings, vector search, and retrieval pipelines over structured and unstructured data

### Multi Agent Personalities App
A Streamlit based app where multiple personality driven AI agents answer a query
Their responses are synthesized into a single clear output

### ML Model Experiments
Created custom datasets, trained multiple ML models, compared performance, and selected optimal approaches
Gained hands on experience with preprocessing, evaluation, and optimization
